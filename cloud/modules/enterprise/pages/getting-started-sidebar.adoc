:summary: The Getting Started sidebar teaches new users to navigate and understand ThoughtSpot.

The *Getting Started* sidebar teaches new users about ThoughtSpot with a brief lesson on navigation and several quick videos on ThoughtSpot's main features.

When you sign in to ThoughtSpot, the *Getting Started* sidebar appears on the right edge of the screen.
It looks like this:

image:/images/gettingstarted-main.png[The Getting Started sidebar]
// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-main.png" title="The Getting Started sidebar" alt="The Getting Started sidebar is on the right edge of the screen." caption="The Getting Started sidebar" %}

[#change-language]
== Change the language

You can change the language that *Getting Started* uses.
ThoughtSpot supports three languages for *Getting Started*: English, Deutsch, and 日本語.

To change the language, open the *Getting Started* menu and click on the language drop-down menu at the top right of the *Getting Started* menu:

// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-changelanguage.png" title="Change the Getting Started language" alt="Change the language at the top right of the Getting Started menu." caption="Change the Getting Started language" %}

When you change the language, the title of the *Getting Started* sidebar changes.

// {% include image.html file="gettingstarted-sidebardeutsch.png" title="Getting Started Sidebar in Deutsch" alt="The title of the Getting Started sidebar changes to Deutsch." caption="Getting Started Sidebar in Deutsch" %}

It also changes the language of the *back* and *next* buttons.
It does not change the text of the lessons.

[#hide-getting-started-menu]
== Hide the Getting Started menu

After you go through the navigation overview and watch the short videos, you may want to hide the *Getting Started* sidebar.

It also includes a *Navigation Overview*, which walks you through the options on ThoughtSpot's top menu bar.
