To change the colors used in a chart, use the *Customize* menu to dive into the chip for the column or value you would like to change.
You can set colors for:

* bars, lines, areas, bubbles, maps, and other visuals on charts
* legends on charts
* tables for conditional formatting
* tags and editing the colors

You can also xref:/end-user/search/apply-conditional-formatting.html[apply a conditional format] to change the color, based on specified criteria.
This type of conditional formatting does not work with Line charts.

Colors are maintained across searches within a session.
For example, when doing a search on revenue by state, each state will keep its color assigned to it even if you change the search or chart type.
