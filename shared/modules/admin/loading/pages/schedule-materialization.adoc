. Click *Schedule*.

NOTE: Refresh works only if it is scheduled in the refresh window set for the cluster (default: 8:00 PM - 4:00 AM).
Only the start time of the refresh window is configurable using the flag `orion.materializationConfig.refreshWindowStartTime` which can be set to values such as `12:00PM` or `01:00AM` etc.
Example: To set the cluster window from 2:00 AM to 10:00 AM you can set the flag as `orion.materializationConfig.refreshWindowStartTime \"02:00AM\"`.
