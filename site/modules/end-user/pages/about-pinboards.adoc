:summary: Create a new pinboard to group and manage related search results. Pinboards are the ThoughtSpot term for a dashboard.

Pinboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

== What are pinboards

You can pin charts and tables to any pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

== Create a pinboard

To create a pinboard:

. Click *Pinboards*, on the top navigation bar.

To add an answer to a pinboard:

. While viewing your answer of interest, click the *Pin* icon at the top right of the answer.

You can also select *Create new pinboard* at the top of the list to create a new pinboard, then add your answer to it.

== Download a pinboard

You can download a pinboard as a PDF file, without having to download each visualization separately.
Downloading a pinboard works just as it would when downloading an answer: simply click the ellipses icon image:/images/icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon] and select *Download as PDF*.

== Other pinboard actions

Other pinboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a pinboard.
Most of these actions are found under the *Actions* button.

Other actions are available on a pinboard display itself.
Some actions always appear, while others appear only when you hover over specific locations of the pinboard.
This diagram displays active action areas on a pinboard.

If you make a change to a pinboard, the system recognizes this and displays an alert message with a *Save changes* button at the top of the page.
Click this button to make your changes permanent.
