:summary: This guide covers all topics of special interest to application administrators.

This guide provides information for application administrators, or users with xref:/admin/setup/logins.adoc[administrative access privileges].

Before addressing the major components of this guide, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the general top-level xref:/admin/architecture/components.adoc[architecture] of the ThoughtSpot service.

Administrators are responsible for many facets of the ThoughtSpot service.
They are most frequently in charge of these common processes:

* xref:/admin/setup/intro.adoc[Installation and setup of ThoughtSpot]
* xref:/admin/loading/loading-intro.adoc[Loading and managing data]
* xref:/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.adoc[Managing users and groups]
* xref:/admin/data-security/about-security.adoc[Security]
* xref:/admin/system-admin/sysadmin-overview.adoc[System administration]
* xref:/admin/backup-restore/choose-strategy.adoc[Backup and Restore]

Additionally, administrators are often involved in the following workflows:

* xref:/admin/data-modeling/about-data-modeling-intro.adoc[Data modeling]
* xref:/admin/worksheets/about-worksheets.adoc[Using worksheets] to simplify search
* xref:/complex-search/about-query-on-query.adoc[Using views] for 'stacked' search;
note that starting with Release 5.2, you can accomplish some aspects of search stacking by using the `IN` keyword (See https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/complex-search/in-keyword-searches.adoc).
* *Beta* xref:/complex-search/about-query-on-query.adoc[Enabling SearchIQ], ThoughtSpot's natural language search.
