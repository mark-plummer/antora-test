You create formulas by combining standard functions and operators, column names, and constant values.

Anyone who can create a worksheet can add a formula to it.
Formulas are not reusable;
the formula you create is associated only with the worksheet it belongs to.
A complete list of available formulas and examples of each is available in the xref:/reference/formula-reference.adoc[Formula function reference].

You can create a formula in a worksheet by using the Formula Builder.
When you do this, the result of the formula gets added to the worksheet as a column.
Use these steps to create a formula:

. xref:/admin/worksheets/about-worksheets.adoc[Create a new worksheet], or xref:/admin/worksheets/edit-worksheet.adoc[edit an existing one].
. Click the *+* button next to *Formulas*.
