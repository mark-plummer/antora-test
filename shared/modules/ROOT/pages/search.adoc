:summary: You use search to answer questions about your data without having to consult a data analyst.

Using ThoughtSpot's relational search is simple, so anyone can use it.
In the search bar, type what you are interested in exploring, for example `revenue midwest sales rep`.
Searches return a set of results in the form of a table or a chart.
ThoughtSpot likes to call this set of results in response to a search an _answer_.
