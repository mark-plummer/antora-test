:summary: Contact ThoughtSpot Support to upgrade a cluster to a new release.

ThoughtSpot is installed or updated from a release tarball that contains the ThoughtSpot application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and Operating System image.
Third party softwares are licensed software components necessary for operation of the ThoughtSpot application.
These include Java, Boost C{pp} libraries, Google protocol buffers, and so on.

ThoughtSpot patches the Operating System at the time of upgrades.
Installation and upgrade use the same process, replacing the older OS image on a node by the new image delivered in the release tarball.
